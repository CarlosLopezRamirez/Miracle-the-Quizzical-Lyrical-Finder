# Miracle the Quizzical Lyrical Finder
Miracle is a Discord bot that implements Discord.py, a Discord API for Python, with the ITunes search API to create a user experience within Discord servers.

Users interact by mentioning Miracle, and when prompted, enter the name of an artist, a song title, an album title, a genre, or even a random word. Miracle will query the ITunes search API and collect (a maximum of 200) results. It will then send the results one by one to the user over the discord channel, prompting with each result if that is the song title that the user would like to proceed with.

After choosing a song out of the 200 results, Miracle will proceed to search for the chosen song's lyrics, and send them to the user over the channel along with a breakdown of lyrical makeup and which words appear most.

THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WIP
